files as they are contained in the linuxtv-dvb-1.? release
and the 2.6.x Linux kernel.

AleVT is not compiled by the main Makefile, because it depends on external
libraries which might not be available in your system (see util/alevt/README for
details). If you have the required libraries, to compile AleVT go to util/alevt/
and type "make".
